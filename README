dak is the collection of programs used to maintain the Debian
project's archives.  It's not yet in a state where it can be easily
used by others; if you want something to maintain a small archive and
apt-ftparchive (from the apt-utils package) is insufficient, I strongly
recommend you investigate mini-dinstall, debarchiver or similar.
However, if you insist on trying to try using dak, please read the
documentation in 'doc/README.first'.

There are some manual pages and READMEs in the doc sub-directory.  The
TODO file is an incomplete list of things needing to be done.

There's a mailing list for discussion, development of and help with
dak.  See:

  https://lists.debian.org/debian-dak/

for archives and details on how to subscribe.

dak is developed and used on Linux but will probably work under any
UNIX since it's almost entirely python and shell scripts.

dak is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, a copy of which
is provided under the name COPYING, or (at your option) any later
